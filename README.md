# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

## What's this about

In order to build powerful models, I need to understand how machine learning algorithms work and how to tune hyperparameters so that I can achieve my goal. The basic idea is to study each algorithm on **Introduction to Statistical Learning** and implement the algorithm. I will try to implement the algorithm without using sklearn if I can because I think it will help me understand how the model works.

## What algorithms to work

I plan to work on algorithms below:

1. Linear Regression (done)
2. Logistic Regression (done)
3. KNN
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. SVM
7. K-means
8. Dimension Reduction
9. XGBoost
10. Gradient Boosting
11. Naive Bayes

## How I work on them

I will work on this in three steps:

1. Understand the theory behind the algorithm including:
  - how to get the formula of the algorithm
  - when to use it
  - cost function
  - pros/ cons
  - compare to similar models
  - mapreduce computation
  - time complexity
  
2. Implement algorithm in Python.
3. Utilize sklearn document to work on adjust parameters to practice improving the algorithm.
